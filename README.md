# mullvad-closest-rs

A CLI tool to quickly find the best Mullvad Server. 

The easiest way to run it is by running

```sh 
cargo run --release
```

For getting help on how to run and configuring the other parameters:
```sh
cargo run --release -- --help
```

Although it supports Windows, Linux, I haven't tested those.

The code is more or less inspired by ```Ch00k/mullvad-closest```
